### Additional comments
* Name your directories using kebab casing
* If relevant, build scripts would be appreciated.
* Do your best to consolidate changes into a single pull request. Sometimes mistakes happen, and I will accommodate multiple pull requests within reason. However, all pull requests must be submitted prior to the deadline.

**No requests submitted after the deadline will be accepted.**
